Acknowledgments

Thank you to Joshua Lisec for an impressive job editing this book and for managing all elements of getting it independently published.

Thank you to my subscribers on Locals, who saved me when the world turned ugly. I can’t thank you enough. I hope I can return the favor.

And thank you to the newspapers and publishing companies that canceled me. I didn’t realize how much I missed my artistic freedom until I got it back.
