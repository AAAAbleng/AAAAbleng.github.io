from Scott Adams

Subscribers on scottadams.locals.com get the new Dilbert Reborn daily comic strip (a spicier and unfiltered version of classic Dilbert), a new comic called Robots Read News (an irreverent analysis of the headlines), more than 200 (and counting) micro lessons on life improvement and talent stacking, frequent livestream videos available nowhere else, my novels God’s Debris and The Religion War, and other special content.

On some days, subscribers help write comics and watch the drawing process in real time. There is a lot of political content too, so don’t be surprised by that. The Locals community has evolved into a digital friend group, and that’s the vibe.

For just the Dilbert Reborn comic without the other nonsense, follow and subscribe on X (formerly known as Twitter), @ScottAdamsSays.
