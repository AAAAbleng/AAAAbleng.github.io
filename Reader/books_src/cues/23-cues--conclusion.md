## CONCLUSION

## Cues Best Practices

Physicist Heinrich Hertz spent years studying electromagnetic waves. Finally, in 1889 he made an incredible discovery. He first conclusively demonstrated the existence of electromagnetic waves—which would turn out to change the way the world communicated forever.

Yet Hertz didn’t see value in his ideas. When asked about the importance of his discovery, he said, “It’s of no use whatsoever.” When asked about the applications of radio waves he stated, “Nothing, I guess.”

Nothing? Little did he know his groundbreaking discovery would go on to fuel innovation in communication, entertainment, and even warfare for _decades._ In 1930, his peers honored him by attaching his name to the unit of frequency.

Hertz grossly underestimated himself and his work. He didn’t see the potential in his idea. He downplayed his experiments.

I meet people like Heinrich Hertz all the time. Brilliant, creative, innovative thinkers who underestimate themselves, doubt their talents, and downplay their work.

No more!

You have ideas worth sharing.

You deserve to be respected, taken seriously, and recognized for your hard work.

Heck, you finished this book, so I know you’re smart as a whip (and amazing).

Every cue in this book has helped me in more ways than I can count. The cues I have shared with you are _exactly_ the cues I use before every meeting, video call, or important conversation. My hope is that these charisma cues will help you and others feel more confident in your ideas. Competent cues will help people take you seriously, respect your ideas, and improve your credibility. Warmth cues will help people put more trust in you, want to work with you, and get excited by your ideas. **But cues are powerful only if you use them.**

Here are some best practices to keep in mind as you activate your cues.

### RULE #1: Expect the Best

Learning to read cues is not about scrutinizing everyone you meet. It’s not about creating “gotcha moments.” It’s not about catching people in lies or constantly being on the hunt for dishonesty. In fact, this approach actually makes you _less_ effective.

Researchers found that the more trusting you are of others, the more accurate you are at spotting hidden emotions. True masters of cue reading expect the best and know how to spot the worst when it arises.

And remember: Cues should never be taken out of context. This is especially true for negative cues. Before jumping to _any_ conclusions about a negative cue, ask yourself: What else might be happening? What has someone experienced _before_ being with you? Did they have a fight with a partner? Did they just step off an airplane? Are they slammed at work? If you see a negative cue, look for context and background first.

### RULE #2: Don’t Fake It

Learning cues is not about pretending to be smarter or more likable than you are. It’s not about using cues as a cover-up. Even the most powerful cues cannot fake expertise . . . at least not in the long run.

If you don’t actually feel competent, please don’t try to pretend. Competence cues will get you only so far, and eventually you will be found out. If you need to buff up your expertise or pump up your skills, make that a priority.

Can you fake warmth? Yes, it’s possible. But it’s also exhausting. If you don’t actually feel warm toward a person, don’t be phony. Work on building true rapport. Find something you actually like about them. Search for common interests. Highlight mutual goals you can agree on even a little bit. It’s way more effort to cover up dislike and inauthenticity. Work on finding real reasons to like someone first so it’s easier to send the right cues.

### RULE #3: Use the Rule of Three

In this book we learned more than forty powerful cues from business leaders, politicians, and world-class communicators. Now you possess the same menu of cues to be charismatic in every interaction.

Challenge yourself to try every cue in this book at least three times. The first time it might feel a little uncomfortable. That’s good! This means you’re learning. The second time, hopefully it will feel a little more empowering. By the third time you’ll be able to consciously decide if it’s a cue you want to add to your toolbox.

The Cues Chart is the best way to track each cue and note how you use them. I recommend trying to

  * Decode each cue at least three times in different scenarios.

  * Encode each cue at least three times in different scenarios.

  * Take notes on how each one could help with your charisma goals.




Here’s a sample row of the Cues Chart to see how our students typically fill it out:

CUE: |  DECODE: |  ENCODE: |  INTERNALIZE:  
---|---|---|---  
**Leaning:** Tilt your body forward to show interest, curiosity, and engagement. |  **1.** Dan did this when he agreed in our meeting. **2.** Local news when both anchors leaned into each other during a joke. **3.** Kids leaned in while waiting for us to serve ice cream. |  **1.** Mirrored Dan when he leaned into me! **2.** Leaned in and down when talking to Sam about bad grades—worked! **3.** Leaned in on video call to show interest. |  *Need to add this to my next presentation!  
  
Now it’s your turn. Track your cue decoding and encoding and see how it makes you feel.

CHARISMA CUES

Use these cues any time you want to be seen as charismatic.

CUE: |  DECODE: |  ENCODE: |  INTERNALIZE:  
---|---|---|---  
**Leaning:** Tilt your body forward to show interest, curiosity, and engagement. |  |  |   
**Anti-Blocking:** An open body signals an open mind. Keep your body free of any blocks—arms, computers, notebooks, purses, or clipboards. |  |  |   
**Fronting:** Align your toes, torso, and top toward the person you are speaking with to show nonverbal respect. |  |  |   
**Space:** Observe all four space zones—intimacy, personal, social, and public—to match your goals. |  |  |   
**Confident Pitch:** Use the lowest natural end of your voice tone to signal confidence. |  |  |   
**Breathing Pause:** Pause in between your words to get breath, slow down, and create intrigue. |  |  |   
**Charismatic Words:** Use words that match your charisma goals. |  |  |   
  
WARM CUES

Use these cues to stimulate warmth, likability, and trust.

CUE: |  DECODE: |  ENCODE: |  INTERNALIZE:  
---|---|---|---  
**Nodding:** Nod to show agreement and engagement. |  |  |   
**Tilting:** Head tilt to show someone you’re listening and interested. |  |  |   
**Eyebrow Raise:** Raise your eyebrows to show intrigue and delight. |  |  |   
**Smiling:** A genuine smile increases and encourages happiness. |  |  |   
**Touch:** Appropriate touch increases the chemical that helps us bond. |  |  |   
**Mirroring:** Subtly match someone’s nonverbal gestures or posture to show respect. |  |  |   
**Permission Warmth:** Start your calls, conversations, and emails by cueing for warmth. |  |  |   
**Vocal Variety:** Avoid vocal funks or sounding too rehearsed. Add vocal emphasis and personality to your voice. |  |  |   
**Vocal Invitations:** Make listening sounds, use verbal nudges, and vocally mirror people to increase warmth. |  |  |   
**Warm Words:** Warm words trigger trust, compassion, and empathy. |  |  |   
  
COMPETENT CUES

Use these cues to trigger competence, capability, and effectiveness.

CUE: |  DECODE: |  ENCODE: |  INTERNALIZE:  
---|---|---|---  
**Power Posture:** Take up space to show confidence. |  |  |   
**Lower Lid Flex:** Flex your lower lid to show you’re intently listening and engaged. |  |  |   
**Steepling:** Steeple to show you’re relaxed and grounded and have it all together. |  |  |   
**Explanatory Gestures:** Use clear hand gestures to demonstrate points. |  |  |   
**Volume Dynamism:** Use volume to support your points—speak up when it matters, speak softer when you want people to lean in. |  |  |   
**Power Pause:** Pause to create intrigue right before an important point. |  |  |   
**Competent Words:** Competent words trigger intelligence, power, and credibility. |  |  |   
  
DANGER ZONE CUES

Don’t try these unless you want to be purposefully negative. But do make a note if you decode one of these cues or accidentally encode one.

CUE: |  DECODE: |  ENCODE: |  INTERNALIZE:  
---|---|---|---  
**Lip Purse:** Pressed lips shows withholding or closing up. |  |  |   
**Distancing:** When we don’t like something or we want someone to move away, step away or lean back to create distance. |  |  |   
**Ventilating:** When we get nervous, we try to get air on our skin to cool ourselves off or give ourselves space. |  |  |   
**Comfort Gesture:** We self-touch to calm ourselves down or comfort ourselves. |  |  |   
**Preen:** When we adjust our hair, makeup, clothing, or accessories to enhance our appearance. |  |  |   
**Suprasternal Notch Touch:** When we’re nervous or want to self-comfort, we touch the notch between our two collarbones (or the tie, necklace, or shirt near it). |  |  |   
**Body Block:** When we want to protect ourselves or self-comfort, we put a barrier in front of our body, mouth, or eyes. |  |  |   
**Shame:** When we feel ashamed, we might touch the sides of our foreheads with our fingertips. |  |  |   
**Anger:** When we feel angry, we pull our eyebrows down into a furrow, harden our lower lids, and tense our lips. |  |  |   
**Nose Flare:** We might flare our nostrils in anger. |  |  |   
**Sadness:** When we feel sad, we pull the corners of our eyebrows down and together, move our lips into a frown, and droop our upper eyelids. |  |  |   
**Mouth Shrug:** Pulling the corners of our mouth down into a frown signals disbelief or doubt. |  |  |   
**Contempt:** When we feel scorn, we pull up one side of our mouth into a smirk. |  |  |   
**Question Inflection:** When we’re asking a question, we go up in vocal pitch at the end of our sentences. Don’t accidentally use it on a statement. |  |  |   
**Vocal Fry:** When we lose breath or feel anxious, our vocal cords rattle together to produce a grating vocal fry. |  |  |   
**Verbal Fillers:** Fluff words and sounds like _um_ , _so_ , _you know_ , and _like_ all signal a lack of confidence or knowledge. |  |  |   
**Vocal Denials:** When we don’t like something, we make negative listening sounds like _ooph_ , _yikes_ , or _ugh_. These signal disagreement. |  |  |   
  
Be sure to practice decoding and encoding each cue in a few scenarios with a few different people—at work, at home, with friends. Dial up your warmth and competence to always be in the sweet spot of the Charisma Zone.

**Make every cue work for you.** Modify them, adapt them, and add your own twists and flairs—although not a nose flare, which can be seen as aggressive.

I’m cheering you on and can’t wait to see how cues change your communication, your interactions, and your confidence as they have changed mine. Even one cue can make all the difference.
