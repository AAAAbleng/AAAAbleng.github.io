# How to convince people

N eil Rackham, the pioneer of spin-selling, once conducted a study to determine what separates a good negotiator from a bad one. His team hired two groups to conduct the study: one with an average career in negotiations and the other with a successful negotiating career.

The experiment made them apply their respective skills on labor and contract negotiations so that both teams could be judged.

There were four main differences between both groups that distinguished the expert negotiators from the average one.

1\. Expert negotiators always came up with a plan.

2\. Successful negotiators never relied on too many arguments.

3\. Expert negotiators never approached the negotiation table with preoccupied defensive or offensive positions.

4\. Experts maneuvered their counterpart’s positions using carefully designed questions.

While it is often thought that coming up with a plan for one's positions is a valid step towards convincing someone on your positions, it hardly achieves anything unless you have carved out a series of steps that make for you a clear pathway for the common ground between your counterpart and yourself. The team of average negotiators thought that arming up against their counterpart would eventually exhaust them. They were right. The average negotiator’s continuous aggression did exhaust their counterpart. However, exhausting someone does not mean convincing them of your positions.

Expert negotiators understood that. So, they invested all their energies into taking opening notes, writing anything common between them and their counterparts down so that they can use those points later to reach an agreement.

The second difference emerged when both teams tried to discuss their options for a potential agreement. The average team delved into coming up with multiple reasons that would support the options they wanted to incorporate in the agreement.

On the other hand, the expert negotiators tried their best to stick with the most relevant reasons that supported their position. So, this is how it works. When you come up with a plethora of reasons to support your claim, it becomes easier for the other party to identify and object to the weakest reasons you have come up with. This gives them an edge over you as, now, they have a stronger reason to refute you with. So, do not let your counterpart win because of your overenthusiasm.

The third most obvious difference between the two teams was related to the attitude of both teams. The average team would come off as harsh and in aggressive mode. Their counterpart would have to delve into defending the attacks by counterattacking the average team. In no time, it would get ugly, leading the negotiations into the territory of nowhere.

On the other hand, the skilled negotiators would keep their calm, act rationally and would not delve into attacking or defending positions. Their reasonableness gave them an edge over their counterparts, making them feel comfortable to come to terms with their position.

The last major difference between the two teams was related to the controlling tactics both teams used. Most of the discussion points proposed by the average team sounded like comments. Thus, the average team did not achieve any control on the discussion front.

On the other hand, the experts presented their proposals and options in an inquisitive tone. One out of each five comments by the expert side sounded like a question. These questions opened up their counterparts to reveal more information. Moreover, the questions opened a way for the experts to take control of the trajectory of discussion between the two parties.
