# Conclusion

_Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know_ will help you rethink individually, on an interpersonal level and collectively. The following paragraphs briefly touch upon the insights that can change the way you think, learn and rethink.

While thinking makes you take that first step, apply that genius idea and reign the world, rethinking makes you challenge your old thoughts. It makes you move on, adapt, take risks and win again. When you want to defend your ideas and values, you switch into your preacher mode. Your preacher's mind makes you promote and defend your values.

When you want to detect flaws in another person’s reasoning, you take the identity of a prosecutor: a suspicious, ever-questioning, skeptical mind. And when you need to get approval from your audience or seek their attention, your mind plays the role of a politician. Use a scientific approach to make your success sustainable. Be open to criticism of your ideas and values and be open to testing them before creating a bias for them.

There are four kinds of people: Certain meek, ignorant arrogant, debilitating doubtful and confident humble. Certain meeks are obsessively insecure about themselves. They are so certain that they are incompetent that they never even bother to try. Ignorant arrogant are so confident in themselves and their values that they hold no regard for constructive criticism.

Debilitating doubtful want to listen to everyone but cannot get their mind around something useful because of the dilemma of having too many choices. Confident humbles doubt their beliefs, but on rational grounds. They are open to new ideas and hence, adaptability. They know that they have to face challenges to grow their confidence. And above all, they understand that self-confidence is achieved by accepting challenges.

People who are thrilled by knowing that they are not always right are more likely to be highly successful. So, accept your flaws whenever you can. Move on from your ignorant biases by telling yourself that you don’t know enough. Repeat the process until you find wisdom through your experiences.

Similarly, in work-related situations, we come across a lot of conflicts. Task conflict is all about the conflict of ideas and opinions. How to proceed during a task, whom to hire, what plan should be followed, are all examples of task-oriented conflict. Relationship conflicts are more personal and have a greater tendency to turn into animosity and mutual-hater.

Teams who initially struggle with relational conflict are unable to proceed smoothly. On the other hand, the teams who have no personal grudges on the way and only opinion-related conflict can get things done because of their openness to different ideas and arguments.

Furthermore, we can all learn effective negotiation skills. Expert negotiators invest all their energies into taking opening notes, writing anything common between them and their counterparts down so that they can use those points later to reach an agreement.

When you come up with a plethora of reasons to support your claim, it becomes easier for the other party to identify and object to the weakest reasons you have come up with. This gives them an edge over you as, now, they have a stronger reason to refute you with. A skilled negotiator would keep his calm, act rationally and would not delve into attacking or defending positions. Your reasonableness gives you an edge over your counterparts, making them feel comfortable to come to terms with your position.

Moreover, it is also crucial that we rethink our prejudices to get the best out of ourselves. Interacting with different types of people can make you open up to different experiences and perspectives that help you question your stereotypes.

Now, it is a whole other thing to persuade people to think differently. Persuasion tends to make people believe in their biases even more if done from the side of authority. The natural reaction to any sort of persuasion is then resistance. Motivational interviewing can help you convince a stubborn subject if you use humility and calmness instead of facts and authority to persuade people to motivate themselves to do or not to do something.

Showing people the other side of the picture rarely helps them in changing or considering to change their views. People aspire for clarity in their life. And to seek clarity, they try to divide an issue into two. This human tendency is called binary bias. If you present an issue in a more complex manner, breaking it into multiple interconnected sub-issues, you can certainly see people opening themselves up for other viewpoints.

As responsible citizens of the world, we also encourage others to be curious about the world around us. Information should not just be consumed, it should be questioned, weighed and assessed. So, if you are in charge of a young mind, allow them to separate the information from the source. Educate them to judge their work, not their worth.

When you feel safe, you try to learn from the mistakes you committed. Safety ingrains in you the spirit to confront work-related difficulties as opportunities. You do not stop yourself from saying your truth, your idea, your insights in a room full of decision-makers.

In short, it is human nature that if we cannot achieve something with the tools and talents we have, we try to invest more of our energies and time into the same goal. So never hesitate to explore new identities you can be.
