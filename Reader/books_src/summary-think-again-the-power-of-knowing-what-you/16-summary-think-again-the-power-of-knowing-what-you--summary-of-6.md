# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 6:

  * SECRET n. 1: You have an experience that stays with you. You try to make sense of what happened and end up generalizing, hence, stereotyping.
  * SECRET n. 2: You experiment an opposite experience with the same party involved which makes you question the generalizations you made. You end up questioning the stereotype you had made earlier.
  * SECRET n. 3: We create stereotypes based on prejudices because of our intrinsic want to belong. In our direst need to belong to a certain group, we end up hating the other group.
  * SECRET n. 4: Interacting with different types of people can make you open up to different experiences and perspectives that help you question your stereotypes.
