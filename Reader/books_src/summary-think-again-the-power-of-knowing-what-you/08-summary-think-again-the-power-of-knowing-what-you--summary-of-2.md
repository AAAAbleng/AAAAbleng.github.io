# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 2:

  * SECRET n. 1: There are four kinds of people: certain meeks, ignorant arrogant, debilitating doubtful and confident humbles. Certain meeks are obsessively insecure about themselves. They are so certain that they are incompetent that they never even bother to try.
  * SECRET n. 2: Ignorant arrogant are so confident in themselves and their values that they hold no regard for constructive criticism. Everything and everyone who goes against their precious ideas holds no value in their life.
  * SECRET n. 3: Debilitating doubtful want to listen to everyone but cannot get their mind around something useful because of the dilemma of having too many choices. They get carried away with too many ideas at one time, doubting their gut all of the time and hence, achieving nothing substantial.
  * SECRET n. 4: Confident humbles doubt their beliefs, but on rational grounds. They are open to new ideas and hence, adaptability. They know that they have to face challenges to grow their confidence. And above all, they understand that self-confidence is achieved by accepting challenges.
