# How to create empathy with other people

D ifficult Conversations Lab is located on the second floor of the red-brick building at the Columbia University. A mind-project of psychologist Peter T. Coleman, Difficult Conversations Lab invites students to have an open discussion on topics that tend to divide an audience into two distinct groups.

In the lab, for instance, if you are pro-guns, you will be paired with another member who strongly opposes guns. Then you will be given some material on the same issue and you will try to conclude together.

Coleman found that when the participants read carefully designed readings that did not only cover the two distinct sides of the same issue but also showed the issue to be deeply complex with multiple dimensions, they were more likely to conclude.

The late 90s gifted humanity with the greatest technology ever: the internet. We thought the internet would solve all our problems based on misinformation. We hoped that the internet will allow us multiple voices and perspectives we will be so keen to hear and acknowledge. But the opposite happened.

That opposite means deeper polarization, deeper levels of hate and fake news. The 2016 election showed us how deeply divided we are and how we are not ready to break our skewed bubbles.

So, you might be thinking that only if we open ourselves up to new opinions and views we can break this vicious cycle of hating and doubting.

Let’s break it to you then. It would not help. Showing people the other side of the picture rarely helps them in changing or considering to change their views. If showing people the other side was useful in uniting them in issues, we would have achieved unity by now as we have been exposing people to different opinions since the dawn of the internet. With the social media platforms allowing everyone to share their opinions, it is also allowing everyone to share misinformation.

Simply knowing that another opinion exists, hence, does not make the preachers doubt their beliefs. It does not make the prosecutors challenge themselves and it does not convince a politician to question his or her stance. All it does is to make all the preachers, prosecutors and politicians hold more tightly to their previous beliefs when now they have something to compare those beliefs with.

People aspire for clarity in their life. To seek clarity, they try to divide an issue into two. This human tendency is called binary bias. We all go through it to make sense of our lives, to believe and to belong.

But if you present an issue in a more complex manner, breaking it into multiple interconnected sub-issues, you can certainly see people opening themselves up for other viewpoints. Complexifying problems allow people to look in a multidimensional realm of ideas without limiting their choice to choose from two. When people have more than two choices, they are more likely to question their previous choices. It breaks the barrier of a tunneled vision as it disrupts dogmatism.

Complexity, thus, is the modern answer to our question of division. It helped Coleman in his experiment. It can help us too.
