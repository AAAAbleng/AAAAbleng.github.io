# How to build a healthy work environment

A few years ago, management professor Amy Edmondson tried to investigate the reasons people make errors in the medical profession. She wanted to find out how health practitioners dealt with their mistakes and what cultural aspects affected the intensity of their mistakes.

So she went to a hospital to try a little experiment to assess the psychological culture that affected the health professionals. She interviewed them while recording their mistakes. To her surprise, she noticed that those professionals who felt psychologically safe reported more mistakes than those who felt insecure.

It was not that the psychologically safe professionals were committing more mistakes, it was just that they felt safe to report even trivial mistakes. On the other hand, those who felt insecure did not even report the mistakes they were committing. Out of fear of getting fired, they instead concealed the information.

We live in a culture in which our value is weighed in terms of our achievements, our efficiency and our performance. When we are likely to be treated as a failure for that one mistake, we build in ourselves a fear of rejection. We constantly try to prove our worth by not making mistakes, by not taking the risk that can be a mistake. If you are in such sort of culture, chances are you are also losing your confidence.

The pressure to say yes to the boss is real and when your boss's things done on time is more important than getting things right, it will only take a little time for you to explore.

The psychological safety at your workplace determines your performance and your growth.

When you feel safe, you try to learn from the mistakes you committed. Safety ingrains in you the spirit to confront work-related difficulties as opportunities.

When you feel safe, you put yourself out there to try new ideas, take new risks.

When you feel safe, you do not stop yourself from saying your truth, your idea, your insights in a room full of decision-makers.

When you feel safe, you are open to being vulnerable. And when you allow yourself to be vulnerable, you open a whole new world of possibilities for yourself.

When you feel safe, you are more likely to listen and value your teammates.

But when you do not feel safe, you look at your mistakes as the end of your career. You are always fearful of the prospects of losing your job. So, you try to conceal your mistakes.

When you do not feel safe, you avoid any kind of responsibility. It is because you are fearful that any new responsibility will prove fatal for your career. So, you avoid taking risks, testing new ideas and taking new responsibilities.

When you do not feel safe, you feel reluctant to share your ideas with your team. You think more about being rejected. You feel like you will not be heard. And hence, to avoid any embarrassment, you censure yourself.

When you do not feel safe, you never talk about your struggles. You only talk about your achievements to create a persona of a go-getter. But this insecurity also makes you conceal important information that could help your team grow and achieve greater success.

When you do not feel safe, you continuously compare yourself with your teammates. You are always in a state of competition. This competition stops you from cooperating with your team to solve common problems, to achieve common goals.

Hence, if you are that boss who wants things done right and well in time, you need to work more on the psychological safety of your team.
