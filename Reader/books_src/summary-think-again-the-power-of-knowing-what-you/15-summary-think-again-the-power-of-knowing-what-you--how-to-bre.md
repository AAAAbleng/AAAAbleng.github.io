# How to break stereotypes

W hat are stereotypes? How do we make them and then fight so hard to defend them?

Let’s make you a little bit uncomfortable to see how stereotypes are built. Suppose that you have spent the life of an orphan during most of your childhood because the cops arrested your father. Now, living a fatherless life must have been excruciating for you.

So, you decided that all cops are responsible for all the fatherless kids out there. Sure, you are all set on this stereotype because of your very solid personal reasons.

However, one day, you hear the news celebrating a cop who rescued a child from his insane father. And there, it gets into your brain. It makes you question the lens you have been wearing all along. So, you say to yourself, “Maybe, not all cops are bad”. And there, you have broken the half-baked stereotype your selective circumstances made you believe in.

Let’s sum it all up and see how stereotypes are built and destroyed.

1\. You have an experience that stays with you.

2\. You try to make sense of what happened and end up generalizing-hence stereotyping.

3\. You experiment an opposite experience with the same party involved.

4\. You question the generalizations you made.

5\. You question the stereotype you had made earlier.

There is one thing common in all of that: experience. Your experiences both create and break the stereotypes in your head.

But the worst thing about stereotypes based on prejudices is that they tend to form animosity because of the most stupid and baseless reasons ever. The most trivial reasons blur your vision and stop you from seeing the similarities between you and your supposed rival.

Paradoxically, we create stereotypes based on prejudices because of our intrinsic want to belong. In our direst need to belong to a certain group, we end up hating the other group. Identity works in two ways: it fulfills our wish to belong and it rewards us with self-gratification when the people like us win against the people who are not like us.

However, if we turn it all around, we can use experiences to turn our mutual rivalries into mutual-respect.

Refer back to the example mentioned at the start of the chapter. Now, if the news of the cop rescuing a kid from a crazy father had not shown up on your TV, you would not have bothered to break the stereotype against cops.

This means one thing: you have to go out of your way to experience life from a different angle so that you do not behave prejudicially against people. Psychologically speaking, we wear the lens of our beliefs for so long that we forget that there are other lenses around through which other people see the world.

So, if we consciously try to create new experiences for us by exchanging the goggles, there is a high possibility that we can bring the world much-needed peace.

All it then takes is a healthy set of new experiences and a focus on our commonalities to keep the world in perpetual harmony.
