# How to spark interest and stimulate curiosity

J ust like any other college graduate in their early twenties, Erin McCarthy had no idea what the future will hold for her. Teaching would be the last thing in her mind as a potential career. She always liked exploring the past, debunking the myths and using such knowledge to create a better present. But she never knew she would find herself teaching a bunch of bored kids about history and historiography.

When she got a job in a museum, she found it irritating that students found no interest or enthusiasm for history. So she decided to write an instruction manual for teachers that could help them help students be curious about the subject. This interaction opened up a possibility for her to teach the students social studies in the classroom. She immediately found that the lack of interest was due to a lack of stimulus in the classroom.

When an eighth-grader came up to her with a complaint about the inaccuracy in the history book, she did not take the criticism to heart. She had planted that inaccuracy to make students find interest in questioning knowledge. Unlike most teachers, she was curious about how knowledge evolve and change. And she used her curiosity to make her pupils curious about her subject.

Using that inaccuracy, she made her students think about the progression of knowledge. She invigorated in them the keenness to look for inconsistencies, to assess information objectively and hence, to learn from their experience.

The teachers can make a huge impact on the lives of students if they keep the following guides in mind:

1\. Information should not just be consumed, it should be questioned, weighed and assessed.

2\. Popularity should not be confused with reliability.

3\. Allow the students to separate the information from the source.

4\. Educate them to judge their work, not their worth.

If you can follow that as a teacher, you have truly made your student their guide.

There was a time when schoolteachers and parents would not have thought of challenging the textbooks. But now, when science is being upgraded, everything has to be. Textbooks do not always tell the truth. It is a fact when the truth is constantly evolving.

Erin showed her students that history, likewise, was ever-evolving knowledge. She assigned her students to look for historical periods and angels overlooked in textbooks. Students would go beyond their means to evolve knowledge. The assignment did not only give them a sense of purpose, but it also allowed them to open themselves up for any possibility.

In traditional schooling, teachers emphasize so much on delivering knowledge and information that they forget that to truly apply any sort of knowledge, students need the enthusiasm that drives them to seek more. Therefore, instead of simply focusing on imparting information, teachers should work to make their students evaluate information. They should encourage them to come up with their information, their solutions to the problems in class.

If we continuously bombard a young mind with all sorts of unprocessed information, they will internalize it so much that it becomes difficult for them to unlearn and relearn. Learning is nothing without relearning.
