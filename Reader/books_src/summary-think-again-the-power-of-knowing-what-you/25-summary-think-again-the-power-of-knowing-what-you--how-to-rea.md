# How to reach your goals with confidence

E arly in our childhood, we are expected to figure out for ourselves who we want to be when we grow up. Some kids want to be pilots, some want to be superheroes, others want to be everything. But do we know what we want from our life? How can a toddler know what he wants in his life? And at what point exactly? Is not growing up a continuous phenomenon?

The issue with our career-oriented culture is that we do not want to stop, reflect and then decide. We just want to decide first and think later. Success then becomes just another career we can pursue.

But what happens when we have achieved the success we intended? Do we stop succeeding? Do we stop living? Do we stop becoming happy?

It is human nature that if we cannot achieve something with the tools and talents we have, we try to invest more of our energies and time into the same goal. Mr. President wanted to conquer Vietnam, so he sent packs of soldiers in to gain the glory he thought he deserved. And when he finally found out that there was no glory in death and chaos, it was too late.

We do the same with our lives and our precious time we have on the planet. We poorly choose a career path that can satiate our luxurious desires. And when we fail at it, we yearn for it even more. Instead of pivoting and looking for something else that suits our natural abilities and talents the best, we continue to persist and persevere.

But perseverance and grit are only useful if you are sure that you are doing something meaningful. When you are sure that you are doing something which aligns with your values. Otherwise, your perseverance is just another stroke in oblivion. This ignorant persistence is called escalation of commitment.

It happens because we want to justify the goals we set at such an early age. We want to justify the decisions we made when we were asked "What do you want to be when you grow up?". To avoid embarrassment, we chose to stick with our faulty commitments.

Escalation of commitment stops us from evolving as an individual. It stops us from rethinking, self-evaluating and growing. And eventually, our identity foreclosure leads us to an identity crisis.

So when you finally feel like losing your identity because of failing in a career you had decided to pursue at a young age, it is time to rethink.

Management professor Herminia Ibarra suggests that before pivoting, you consider doing the following:

1\. Explore new identities you can be. The best way to explore yourself is to see whom you look up to. Ask yourself who inspires you in or out of your field. Then try to observe and see what they do all day to give meaning to their lives and to inspire you.

2\. After exploring these identities, try to find out how you adjust to such an identity with the talents you have and the skills you have acquired.

3\. Lastly, you need to run your experiment. Ask the people questions about the daily work in the particular field you want to switch to. Do a few sample projects to know if you enjoy them.

When you have gone through these steps, you are officially ready to transition your career path and your life.
