# How to gain confident humility

F or many of us, confidence is the key to success. People often judge others based on confidence: if it is too much, they are perceived as arrogant and if it is not enough, they are perceived as weak.

And then there is humility. Humility is the most misunderstood trait in our corporate environment. People think that if you are not sure, it is because you do not know enough. And hence, they end up relating your humility to your incompetence.

Humility does not mean incompetence. It means embracing one’s flaws. It means accepting reasonable opinions. It means thinking out of one’s comfort zone to achieve the best for all. It is the ability to doubt oneself and attempt to clarify doubts.

However, most people tend to dwell in two extremes. And extremes never help. So what helps? What is the right balance someone can achieve to create a good life, a great company and everlasting bliss for oneself?

To understand that, we need to segregate common tropes in our daily work life. There are four kinds of people in our corporate environment: those who are certain of their inferiority, those who are certain about their superiority, those who can't get rid of their doubt and those who are confident in their humility.

Let's talk about the certain lot who is obsessively insecure about themselves. They are so certain that they are incompetent that they never even bother to try. They lose confidence as they do not challenge themselves. And hence, they get stuck in a vicious cycle of achieving absolutely nothing when faced with a challenge they fail. They fail again because they did not bother to learn from their previous mistake.

Then some are so confident in themselves and their values that they hold no regard for constructive criticism. They are the pure definition of the ignorant arrogant. Everything and everyone who goes against their precious ideas holds no value in their life. But there is an awkward advantage of being a blindly arrogant manager: people listen to you even if you are wrong. The obvious disadvantage is that you are wrong most of the time. Another disadvantage is that you make an enemy out of friends and you don't want that.

Then there is this moderate kind of people who want to listen to everyone but cannot get their mind around something useful because of the dilemma of having too many choices. They get carried away with too many ideas at one time, doubting their gut all of the time and hence, achieving nothing substantial. They think that if they had confidence, they would have achieved x, y and z. But they fail to understand that confidence is an evolutionary process. It is gained, not inherited.

The last kind happens to understand that. They doubt their beliefs, but on rational grounds. They are open to new ideas and hence, adaptability. They know that they have to face challenges to grow their confidence. And above all, they understand that self-confidence is achieved by learning from mistakes, taking challenges, overcoming them and gaining success.

When you welcome your imposter syndrome to get things done, embrace your challenges and work to overcome them, you truly become a success in yourself. Self-doubt is important, but it can only be taken advantage of if you are ready to deconstruct it, work on it and overpower it.

So, be confident in your humility to keep on growing.
