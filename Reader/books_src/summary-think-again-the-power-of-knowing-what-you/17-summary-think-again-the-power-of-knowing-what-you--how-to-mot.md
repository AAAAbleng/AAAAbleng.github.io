# How to motivate people to change

I n September 2018, Marie-Hélène Étienne-Rousseau went into nan early labor. Her son Tobie was due in three months. His birth was already a risky case, but the risk of measles made it worse. And then Marie-Hélène saw the news of the epidemic spreading day by day in her local community in Quebec.

Alongside the measles epidemic, another and yet more dangerous epidemic was slowly spreading: the epidemic of rumors and fake news. Marie-Hélène’s friends were afraid that if their kids were vaccinated, they will later show the symptoms of autism.

People are increasingly being skeptical of modern-day science because of the active conspiracy theorists. Almost one in a thousand kids die of measles every year because people in the developed world, such as Canada, are skeptical about modern-day solutions to their very own problems.

So, to prevent further deaths from measles, governments tried to reprimand parents who prevent their children from getting a vaccination. A few others even tried to jail them for six months. However, the results showed that it would not work like that. People were equally skeptical of their governments now with tasting prosecution for committing a crime they did not think was a crime at all.

When strict measures failed to give a positive response towards vaccination, governments decided to go lenient with their punishments. Instead of punishing the parents, they hired healthcare workers to preach to them about the consequences of not getting their kids vaccinated. Preaching solid atheists in vaccines did not work either. All the preaching enhanced people’s doubts about vaccination, making them resist it with more conviction.

So the natural question you must ask is what went wrong?

Persistence supported by stubborn facts never achieves anything when it comes to persuading people who are equally stubborn in their beliefs. The issue with persuasion is that it tends to make people believe in their biases even more if done from a side of authority. The natural reaction to any sort of persuasion is the resistance. Persuasion and resistance work hands in hands, just like a vaccine works with our immune system. All it takes is an external push for our immune system to make it resist the virus trying to make it into our system.

So what should we do to persuade resisting audiences?

Back in the 1980s, clinical psychologist Bill Miller came up with a persuasion tactic that works best on stubborn people. He called it motivational interviewing.

Motivational interviewing challenged the notion that you can convince a person who is already convinced. People do not resist because they are unable to process a piece of valuable advice. They resist because they hate authority that makes decisions for them. Then it does not matter if the authority’s decision is right, they would do their best to resist them.

Miller suggests that persuaders use humility and calmness instead of facts and authority to persuade people to motivate themselves to do or not to do something. No one knows except the person himself about their motivations. So, what motivational interviewers can do is lead people to their motivations by showing curiosity. Invigorate in them the curiosity for another perspective. Let them struggle through it on their own. And there, if you have convinced a person to rethink their initial thought, you have done the job of persuading them.

Most motivational interviewers use the following key steps to lead their subject to find their motivations:

1\. They ask the subjects open-ended questions.

2\. They listen actively while keeping them engaged in discussions.

3\. They actively affirm the subject’s want and curiosity to transform.

The same strategy worked with Marie-Hélène when her advisor showed her the options she had about the health of her child. He managed to show respect for her freedom to choose and she got Tobie vaccinated the same day.
