# How not to be biased

M ike Lazaridis was a genius. Since the age of four, he had decided to dedicate his life to anything and everything electronics. A breakthrough came in his life when he won Oscar and Emmy for a device he made to read the barcodes on films which revolutionized the film industry. But there was more to his name: Blackberry. A phone that kept secrets without the burden of carrying any wires.

By 2009, almost half of the mobile phone users in the USA had Blackberry which meant Mike’s company and products were thriving.

However, by 2014, Blackberry plunged into deep waters owning a share of merely 1% in the mobile market. So, what really happened?

Blackberry lost interest in innovation, adaptation and thinking with the new world new decade brought. But above all, Blackberry lost the smartphone game because of its lack of will to rethink.

Rethinking is equally important as thinking is. While thinking makes you take that first step, apply that genius idea and reign the world, rethinking makes you challenge your old thoughts. It makes you move on, adapt, take risks and win again. But the best thing rethinking does is that it makes your success sustainable.

But here is one problem. As we continue to think, rethink and rethink that rethought thought again, we are creating wider and wider knowledge in the form of information. We are continuously challenging our old ways. Old ways now mean last year, last month, last week and even yesterday.

Thirty years ago, Pluto was a healthy, revolving planet for all the kids of the old 90s. And now, astronomy is different, math is more advanced, literature has expanded and we find ourselves in a plethora of new and ever-evolving knowledge. So it begs the question: How do we process it all?

**Preachers, Prosecutors and Politician**

Almost two decades ago, Phil Tetlock devised a scheme to explain how we process information and act upon it. According to him, the human mind switches among three kinds of roles: preacher, prosecutor and politician.

When you want to defend your ideas and values you have worked on to adopt since your childhood, you switch into your preacher mode. Your preacher's mind makes you promote and defend your values.

But when we want to detect flaws in another person’s reasoning, we take the identity of a prosecutor: a suspicious, ever-questioning, skeptical mind.

Similarly, when we need to get approval from our audience or seek their attention, we play the role of a politician.

But here is the problem. We internalize all of these modes so much to defend and preach our values, criticize our opponent and seek attention, that we forget that our values can be flawed, our opponent might have a point and our audience may not be interested.

So, what should we be? We should be those scientists who are open to criticism of their ideas and values. We should be the scientist who is open to new ideas, but who is also open to testing them before creating a bias for them. And finally, we should be the scientist who is up-to-date with what other scientists have to say.

If Mike had been open to a new world, Blackberry would have been competing with Apple that took on the role of a scientist open to new ideas, experiments and feedback.
