# How to resolve your conflicts

W ilbur and Orville Wright would do everything together. From their first mission to rebuild a broken toy helicopter together to launch a newspaper, they would be side by side every step of the way. And then, they would go on to create their first flying machine that would shock everyone.

So, what does it take to achieve big things in life? Is it the unbreakable bond that determines the outcome or is it persistence? And what about constructive conflict? How can anything grow into a world marvel without an iota of conflict? Would not the world be boring, unimaginative and uncreative without arguments, clashing opinions and occasional disagreements?

Australian organizational psychologist Karen Etty Jen opines that conflict and even conflict-provoked animosities are part and parcel of any kind of human behavior, especially organizational behavior. According to Jehn, there are two main types of conflict that employees, entrepreneurs and employers face during their lifetime as a consequence of being human: relationship conflict and task conflict.

Relationship conflicts are more personal and have a greater tendency to turn into animosity and mutual-hater. As a consequence of unresolved relationship conflict, things at work or home, do not proceed smoothly. Things, instead, get stuck. Relationships break. And therefore, nothing gets done.

On the other hand, task conflict is all about the conflict of ideas and opinions. How to proceed during a task, whom to hire, what plan should be followed, are all examples of task-oriented conflict. The main problem that should be discussed here is whether either kind of conflict leads to different outcomes if unresolved.

We all face organizational conflicts. A few years back, when Adam Grant went through studying the condition of organizational conflict among Silicon Valley employees, he found that even when they all had all sorts of clashing opinions, they were able to find what sort of conflict they were experiencing when they got their heads around to consciously resolve them.

The Silicon Valley teams who were having relationships-oriented conflict struggled through performance and effectiveness at work. On the other hand, task-oriented conflicts, although, created initial difficulties among the teams, upon resolving them, they achieved greater effectiveness at work.

Another pattern observed showed that teams who initially struggled with relational conflict were unable to proceed smoothly. But the teams who had no personal grudges on the way and only opinion-related conflict were able to get things done because of their openness to different ideas and arguments.

Therefore, relationship conflicts are more lethal when it comes to team performance mainly because such conflicts destroy the team dynamic and mutual-respect. Moreover, the same personal grudges impede the most important process for any success: rethinking.
