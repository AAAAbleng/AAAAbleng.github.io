# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 5:

  * SECRET n. 1: Expert negotiators invest all their energies into taking opening notes, writing anything common between them and their counterparts down so that they can use those points later to reach an agreement.
  * SECRET n. 2: When you come up with a plethora of reasons to support your claim, it becomes easier for the other party to identify and object to the weakest reasons you have come up with. This gives them an edge over you as, now, they have a stronger reason to refute you with.
  * SECRET n. 3: A skilled negotiator would keep his calm, act rationally and would not delve into attacking or defending positions. Your reasonableness gives you an edge over your counterparts, making them feel comfortable to come to terms with your position.
  * SECRET n. 4: Questions open a way for the negotiators to take control of the trajectory of discussion between parties.
