# How to accept your mistakes

B ack in 1959, researcher, Henry Murray made a few sophomores at Harvard sign up for an experiment that challenged their belief system. He was of the view that psychology was not paying enough attention to knowing more about how people behave in difficult situations. So, he gave the students time to write in detail about their worldview, ideologies and philosophy of life.

When the students were finally called to submit their homework, they were asked to read other students’ assignments and argue about their beliefs.

Murray used the same psychological model he had used before after World War Two to recruit spies in the Office of Strategic Services which later became the Central Intelligence Service, CIA. Each candidate for the spy job would be interrogated and bashed on the inconsistencies on his accounts. Those who could handle the pressure of being called a liar were recruited.

In the university experiment, Murray systemized it better. Each student had to counter aggressive attacks on their beliefs for eighteen minutes by law students planted by Murray. As the attacks were personal, they would make most of the students feel angry and anxious.

The experience was bad for some, worst for others. Some forgot the humiliation in a week. And then, some enjoyed the experience.

These are the sort of people who achieve the highest good for themselves by getting thrilled by knowing that they are not always right. The same sort of people teaches us to accept our flaws whenever we can, to move on from our ignorant biases whenever we can and to surprise ourselves with the right we never knew existed.

True wisdom is in knowing our wrong choices, our mistakes, our narrow thinking and our skewed beliefs. So if you want to be wise, follow the following steps:

1\. Live your life.

2\. Make mistakes while you can.

3\. Accept your mistakes and then learn from them.

4\. Repeat until you find wisdom in through your experiences.

5\. Make some more mistakes by applying the wisdom you gained in step 4 and then realize that it was not wise to apply that wisdom in every other situation.

6\. Keep following steps 1 to 5 for life.

Congratulations, you are wise now. But do not believe in your acquired wisdom. Instead, learn to stay curious and keep challenging your biases.

The crux of the matter is that you have to unlearn a great deal to truly gain wisdom. All you have to do is seek thrill in your mistakes and learn from them.
