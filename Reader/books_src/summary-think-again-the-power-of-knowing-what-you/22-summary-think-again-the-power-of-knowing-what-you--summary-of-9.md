# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 9:

  * SECRET n. 1: Information should not just be consumed, it should be questioned, weighed and assessed.
  * SECRET n. 2: Popularity should not be confused with reliability.
  * SECRET n. 3: Allow the students to separate the information from the source.
  * SECRET n. 4: Educate the students to judge their work, not their worth.
  * SECRET n. 5: If we continuously bombard a young mind with all sorts of unprocessed information, they will internalize it so much that it becomes difficult for them to unlearn and relearn. Learning is nothing without relearning.
