# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 7:

  * SECRET n. 1: Persuasion tends to make people believe in their biases even more if done from the side of authority. The natural reaction to any sort of persuasion is then resistance.
  * SECRET n. 2: Motivational interviewing can help you convince a stubborn subject if you use humility and calmness instead of facts and authority to persuade people to motivate themselves to do or not to do something.
  * SECRET n. 3: During a motivational interview, ask the subjects open-ended questions to dive into things that motivate them. Listen actively while keeping your subjects engaged in a discussion. And finally, actively affirm your subject’s want and curiosity to transform into a better person.
