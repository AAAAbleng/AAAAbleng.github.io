# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 3:

  * SECRET n. 1: People who are thrilled by knowing that they are not always right are more likely to be highly successful.
  * SECRET n. 2: Accept your flaws whenever you can. Move on from your ignorant biases by telling yourself that you don't know enough. Be surprised with what you learned on your journey.
  * SECRET n. 3: To be truly wise, live your life, make mistakes, accept them and learn from them. Repeat the process until you find wisdom through your experiences. But do not believe in your acquired wisdom. Instead, learn to stay curious and keep challenging your biases.
