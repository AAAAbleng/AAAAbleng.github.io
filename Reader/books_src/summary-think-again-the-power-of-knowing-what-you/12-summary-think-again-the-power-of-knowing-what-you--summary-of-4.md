# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 4:

  * SECRET n. 1: Task conflict is all about the conflict of ideas and opinions. How to proceed during a task, whom to hire, what plan should be followed, are all examples of task-oriented conflict.
  * SECRET n. 2: Relationship conflicts are more personal and have a greater tendency to turn into animosity and mutual-hater. As a consequence of unresolved relationship conflict, things at work or home, do not proceed smoothly.
  * SECRET n. 3: Teams who initially struggle with relational conflict are unable to proceed smoothly. But the teams who have no personal grudges on the way and only opinion-related conflict can get things done because of their openness to different ideas and arguments.
  * SECRET n. 4: Personal grudges impede the most important process for any success: rethinking.
