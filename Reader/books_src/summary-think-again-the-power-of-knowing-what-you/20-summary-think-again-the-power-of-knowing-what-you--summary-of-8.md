# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 8:

  * SECRET n. 1: Showing people the other side of the picture rarely helps them in changing or considering to change their views.
  * SECRET n. 2: People aspire for clarity in their life and to seek clarity, they try to divide an issue into two. This human tendency is called binary bias and we all go through it to make sense of our lives, to believe and to belong.
  * SECRET n. 3: If you present an issue in a more complex manner, breaking it into multiple interconnected sub-issues, you can certainly see people opening themselves up for other viewpoints.
  * SECRET n. 4: When people have more than two choices, they are more likely to question their previous choices.
