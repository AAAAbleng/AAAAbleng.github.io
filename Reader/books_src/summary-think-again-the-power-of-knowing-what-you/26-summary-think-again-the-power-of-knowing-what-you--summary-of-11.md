# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 11:

  * SECRET n. 1: It is human nature that if we cannot achieve something with the tools and talents we have, we try to invest more of our energies and time into the same goal.
  * SECRET n. 2: Escalation of commitment stops us from evolving as an individual. It stops us from rethinking, self-evaluating and growing. And eventually, our identity foreclosure leads us to an identity crisis.
  * SECRET n. 3: Explore new identities you can be. The best way to explore yourself is to see whom you look up to. Ask yourself who inspires you in or out of your field. Then try to observe and see what they do all day to give meaning to their lives and to inspire you.
  * SECRET n. 4: Try to find out how you adjust to such an identity with the talents you have and the skills you have acquired.
  * SECRET n. 5: You need to run your experiment. Ask the people questions about the daily work in the particular field you want to switch to. Do a few sample projects to know if you enjoy them.
