# SUMMARY OF CHAPTER 1:

  * SECRET n. 1: While thinking makes you take that first step, apply that genius idea and reign the world, rethinking makes you challenge your old thoughts. It makes you move on, adapt, take risks and win again.
  * SECRET n. 2: When you want to defend your ideas and values, you switch into your preacher mode. Your preacher's mind makes you promote and defend your values.
  * SECRET n. 3: When you want to detect flaws in another person’s reasoning, you take the identity of a prosecutor: a suspicious, ever-questioning, skeptical mind.
  * SECRET n. 4: When you need to get approval from your audience or seek their attention, your mind plays the role of a politician.
  * SECRET n. 5: Use a scientific approach to make your success sustainable. Be open to criticism of your ideas and values and be open to testing them before creating a bias for them.
