[*](../Text/18_Chapter_8_Charged_Con.xhtml#footnote-021-backlink "footnote reference") It turns out that younger Anglo Americans are more likely than their older or Asian American counterparts to reject mixed emotions, like feeling happy and sad at the same time. The difference seems to lie in comfort accepting dualities and paradoxes. I think it might help if we had richer language to capture ambivalent emotions. For example, Japanese gives us _koi no yokan_ , the feeling that it wasn’t love at first sight but we could grow to love the person over time. The Inuit have _iktsuarpok_ , the mix of anticipation and anxiety when we’re awaiting the arrival of a guest at our house. Georgians have _shemomedjamo_ , the feeling of being completely full but eating anyway because the meal is so good. My favorite emotion word is German: _kummerspeck_ , the extra weight we gain from emotional overeating when we’re sad. The literal translation of that one: “grief bacon.” I can see that coming in handy in charged conversations: _I didn’t mean to insult you. I’m just working through some grief bacon right now._
